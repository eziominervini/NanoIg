INITIAL EDGES
-------- ----------------------------------------
      45 reads are contained
     436 reads have no best edges (singleton)
       2 reads have only one best edge (spur) 
                2 are mutual best
       1 reads have two best edges 
                0 have one mutual best edge
                1 have two mutual best edges


ERROR RATES (50 samples)
-----------
mean   0.00881000 stddev 0.00433360 -> 0.03481161 fraction error =   3.481161% error
median 0.00800000 mad    0.00330000 -> 0.03735548 fraction error =   3.735548% error


EDGE FILTERING
-------- ------------------------------------------
     436 reads have a suspicious overlap pattern
       0 reads had edges filtered
                0 had one
                0 had two
       0 reads have length incompatible edges
                0 have one
                0 have two
